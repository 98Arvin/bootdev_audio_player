# Audio Player on Boot.dev

This Greasemonkey script enhances the audio player experience on Boot.dev by keeping the audio player fixed to the bottom center (few pixels to the left), resizing it, and providing keyboard shortcuts for play/pause, open, and seek back 10 seconds (tested in Firefox).

## Features

* Fixes the audio player to the bottom center (few pixels to the left)
* Resizes the audio player to fit within the viewport
* Opens the audio player with Alt+Z
* Toggles play/pause with Alt+X
* Seeks back 10 seconds with Alt+C

## Usage

1. Install the script with Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Google Chrome)
2. Navigate to a lesson on Boot.dev - `https://www.boot.dev/lessons/*`
3. The script will automatically fix the audio player and enable keyboard shortcuts.
